Hello Earthlings, I know my website doesn't look cool yet, but I will make it a bit entertaining for you guys. Here are some jokes I came up with for you guys. 1."What's the best thing about Switzerland?... I don't know, but the flag is a big plus" 2. "Are monsters good at math?... Not unless you Count Dracula!" 3."I am a teller at a bank. Today, an old lady came over to me and asked me to check her balance... So I pushed her over!"          :) Thanks for reading and enjoying these jokes.
